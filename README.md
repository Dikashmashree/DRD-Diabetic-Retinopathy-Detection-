Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 
Creating this model was an impulsive decision
One of my friend's from Biomedical field was competiting in a competition and had no idea to find a clear solution.
all that she said me was"I want an AI model to detect the retinopathy
and I suggested her that this is a deep learning problem and BOOM ,I created this the same day

and also special thanks to google for helping me out for references
